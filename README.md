The Odin Project online curriculum exercise that involves the implementation of a Breadth-first traversal algorithm to determine the shortest path from a knight to a chosen destination. 

Click anywhere on the chess board to move the knight to a new location. Once the knight has been moved the chessboard will update and display a numbered sequence illustrating the shortest path to the chosen destination.

The destination can also be updated with the textbox below the chessboard. It accepts two formats - X, Y or X,Y (with space and without space between the two coordinates).
